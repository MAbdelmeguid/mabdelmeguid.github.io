Welcome! My name is Mohamed Abdelmeguid, I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech GALCIT. I obtained my PhD from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. My research focuses on utilizing experimental, theoretical, and computational mechanics to study dynamic failure and wave propagation during frictional sliding. My interests span a wide range of topics, including multi-physics and multi-scale modeling, fault zone physics, experimental analysis of dynamic fracture, wave propagation in solids, computational fluid dynamics, and structural analysis. The objective of my work is to develop physics-based models to understand the intricacies of dynamic failure within natural and engineered systems. Currently, my work has applications in geophysics, seismology, and structural engineering.
